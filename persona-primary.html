    <h3>Detailed Description:</h3>
    <p>Popescu Adrian (primary persona) is a student at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University Iași and because he’s from
        Suceava, he needs to travel by train very often. Because of that he became irritated by the flaws in CFR like:
        poorly
        organized train schedule (trains that are late are not shown), unreliable information (display of outdated train
        routes), poor visibility of train information (train number, train line number, the wagon number that is
        displayed is not always the correct one).</p>
    <p>He often uses the ‘CFR calatori’ application because he can get a student discount and buy the ticket a week
        earlier. He leaves for the university on Sunday evening and comes back home to Suceava at the end of the week,
        and because of that he uses the application very often.</p>
    <p>He also needs to travel from the train station to his room in the campus and uses 24pay to buy bus tickets, so he
        has experience with these apps.</p>


    <h3>Scenarios:</h3>
    <p>Popescu Adrian decided to install this application to navigate easier in the train station. Now he also knows
        what is said through the speakers because he can replay the recording from his phone.</p>
